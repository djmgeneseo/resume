1. Build trust with future customer by gifting them something: a free e-book
2. Strong call-to-action button, in different areas of website
3. Pop-up box to ask for an email for newsletter (actually works!)
4. Make button text something inviting: "TRY FOR FREE"
5. Fewer fields convert better: don't ask for personal information, or too much.
6. Use social proof: get testimonials
7. Urgency: Limited time/limited quantity nearby call-to-action button.
8. Scarcity: when there's less of something, we value it more.
